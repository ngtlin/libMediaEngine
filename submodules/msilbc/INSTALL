This autoconf package installs the plugin into the mediastreamer
directory under /usr/local.  Please use './configure --prefix' to
change it.

For successful compilation, the package libilbc0-rfc3951 or similar
must be installed.  You need the shared library libilbc0 and the
pkg-config file with the build options. If you are using a package
manager to install libilbc0, please keep in mind that pkg-config
file could be located among development files.  In many distributions
those are in a separate package, such as libilbc0-rfc3951-dev.

This package makes it optional to use 30ms frames.  Please note that
some VOIP providers, such as Gizmo5 (aka Sipphone), require the use
of 30ms frames.

To use 30ms packets, please just run:

  ./configure

To use 20ms frames, please define the environment variable
MSILBC_CFLAGS="-DUSE_20MS_FRAMES=1" or invoke configure with:

  ./configure MSILBC_CFLAGS="-DUSE_20MS_FRAMES=1"

or

  ./configure --enable-20ms-frames
